# Machine-Learning-For-Science-and-Profit-CS156
CS156 Machine Learning Class at Minerva.
Built many projects about machine leanring models, many times building them from scratch. 
Also made a tutorial about Capsule Neural Networks as the Final Project, found in Medium: https://towardsdatascience.com/capsule-neural-networks-are-here-to-finally-recognize-spatial-relationships-693b7c99b12
